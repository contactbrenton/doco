# Cyber Risk

Over the past twelve months, I've been working quite closely with a cyber security consultant \(Corch, from Shogun Cybersecurity\), which has fundamentally changed how I think about IT and cyber security in general. I've always been fascinated by the topic, and over the last 10 or so years I have absorbed every piece of information I can find.

Recently Corch wrote an article on his blog about his experience providing best in class cyber security services with small businesses clients. His conclusion was that its your IT provider who us the root of your cyber security problems, and he makes a lot of really valid points.

But let's step back for a minute and look at the environment which led to the reality that Corch so vividly described. What are the conditions that led to so many of the small business I meet having shameful cybersecurity?

I think it boils down to three areas;

1. A focus on technology, not business risk
2. Skills gap, both from IT and leadership
3. A culture of overconfidence

My recent talk at the Australian Cyber Security Conference in Melbourne was all about this challenge. 

### Technology, not risk

The way Corch and my industry peers talk about cyber security is very different. The thing that stands out most to me is that instead of talking about a list of products and technology controls, Corch speaks broadly about risk. Don't get me wrong here, Corch is one of the most technically capable people I know, but rather than spending a lot of time evaluating a lot of vendor products, he instead invests the time and energy in establishing the organisational cybersecurity needs.

In contrast, if I have another conversation with an IT provider about what the best antivirus is, or that dropbox isn't secure because Microsoft doesn't own it, I'm probably going to go postal. For most IT providers, security is really "what percentage of my customers buy the correct security stuff from me" rather than any real focus on the people and process part of cyber security. If you need any real evidence of this, just have a look at the unbelievably low adoption of controls like MFA and unique passwords and you can see why 24% of ransomware incidents are caused by an IT provider or vendor \(Beazley, 2019\).

### Skills Gap



### Culture of Overconfidence

When asked, 1 in 5 Australian SMEs said the weakest link in their cyber defences was; “there is no weak link” \(Chubb 2019\). I would love to see a survey of IT providers, I would expect this number would be a lot higher. 



Incentives

Australian SMEs doubled down when asked what the weakest link in their cyber defences were, with 1 in 5 \(21%\) saying “there is no weak link”. 14% said they didn’t know, with employees \(19%\), security software \(13%\) and monitoring of the security software \(11%\) rounding out the top five weakest links.
