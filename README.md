# Cyber Risk

Over the past twelve months, I've been working quite closely with a cyber security consultant \(Corch, from Shogun Cybersecurity\), which has fundamentally changed how I think about IT and cyber security in general. I've always been fascinated by the topic, and over the last 10 or so years I have absorbed every piece of information I can find.

Recently Corch wrote an article on his blog about his experience providing best in class cyber security services with small businesses clients. His conclusion was that its your IT provider who us the root of your cyber security problems, and he makes a lot of really valid points.

But let's step back for a minute and look at the environment which led to the reality that Corch so vividly described. My recent talk at the Australian Cyber Security Conference in Melbourne was all about this challenge. 



1. Culture and overconfidence
2. Focus on technology, not business risk
3. Skills gap, both from IT and leadership
